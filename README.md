A motion detection system using python Motion Detection Using Python Project Overview The Motion Detection Using Python project utilizes computer vision techniques to detect motion in video feeds. By using Python libraries like OpenCV, the system identifies changes in video frames, highlighting areas where movement occurs. This project can be applied in security systems, surveillance applications, or even as a simple tool to monitor activity in a specific area. It is capable of detecting motion in real-time and can trigger actions like saving images, sending alerts, or starting a recording when movement is detected.

Key Features Real-time Motion Detection:

Detects motion in video streams from a webcam or video file. Provides immediate feedback when motion is detected in the video frame. Frame Differencing:

Compares consecutive frames to identify changes and detect movement. Bounding Box:

Draws bounding boxes around the detected moving objects, helping to visualize the area of movement. Motion Threshold:

Adjustable threshold to filter out small, irrelevant movements, ensuring more accurate detection. Trigger Actions:

Can save frames (images) when motion is detected. Capable of triggering an alert (like sending an email or notification). Background Subtraction:

Uses background subtraction methods to isolate moving objects from a static background. Video Input Support:

Accepts video feeds from both local webcam and external video files. Low Resource Usage:

Designed to run efficiently on devices with lower computational power, making it suitable for IoT or Raspberry Pi projects. Customization:

Easy to customize the sensitivity, detection area, or actions taken when motion is detected. Visualization:

Displays real-time video frames with highlighted motion areas in an easy-to-understand GUI. Technologies Used Programming Language: Python Libraries: OpenCV (for computer vision), NumPy (for array manipulations) Video Input: Webcam, local video files (MP4, AVI, etc.) Optional: smtplib (for email alerts), threading (for efficient processing) Installation Guide Clone the Repository:
